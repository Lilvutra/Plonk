About extension finite fields

The base case - GF(p)

We know about finite field of size p GF(p) Z/pZ, elements are {0,1,2,...,p-1}
-> An example if integer n modulo p(prime)(pause a bit to think about why we need to mod a prime but not other numbers). Since we mod a prime, the set contains Z because any integers that mods p wraps around 

What if we want more elements aka larger fields to work with big p?
-> finite field extension
-> use polynomials, but why use polynomials?
-> We need a systematic way to build new elements while perserving closure, associativity,... and polynomials are general way of expressing such manipulation https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1626020/why-are-the-elements-of-a-galois-finite-field-represented-as-polynomials
